### **A Cozy, Vibe-Focused Music Player for Neovim**

---

### **Overview**

**RadioVibe.nvim** is a lightweight and aesthetically pleasing music player plugin for Neovim. It brings the cozy, nostalgic feel of a lo-fi or chill-hop radio station directly into your editor with a dynamic, animated ASCII art display and integrated music playback. This plugin is designed for developers who want to set a relaxed coding atmosphere without leaving their Neovim environment.

---

### **Features**

-   **Floating ASCII Art Display**: A minimalist, animated floating window with a charming ASCII character.
-   **Integrated Music Player**: Built-in functionality to play music files using **mpv** as a backend. There's no need for a separate terminal or application.
-   **Playback Controls**: You can easily toggle playback, adjust volume, and control looping directly from Neovim commands.
-   **Customizable**: Configure the music path, mpv executable, and animation frames to suit your preferences.
-   **Clean and Unobtrusive**: The floating window can be toggled on and off, allowing you to focus on your code when you need to.

---

### **Requirements**

-   Neovim **0.8** or higher
-   **mpv**: The media player must be installed and accessible in your system's PATH.
